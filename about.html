            <h3>About AquaHomes /</h3>
            <p>AquaHomes founder James Kennedy is a mature student (with an academic background in film and broadcasting) who recently completed a course in Creative Thinking, Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Trinity College (2019). AquaHomes is his third start-up idea. He has already developed a solar-powered DJ/mobile music station that tours the Irish festivals circuit and started a business turning buses into living spaces.</p>
            <p>An AquaHome boat, is approx. 9.2m long and 3.2m wide and will have a kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and living area, will cost about &euro;36,000 fully fitted out. Ultimately, the founder of AquaHomes, James Kennedy would like to repurpose an old factory to refurbish the barges (possibly in Wicklow where there are already marine skills in the community) on a commercial scale for sale both here and overseas. Further down the line he has plans to expand the business by designing a completely new type of boat that is suitable for floating living.</p>
            <p>Kennedy knows that he can't solve the housing crisis by himself but even if he can be part of helping to fix the issue in some way, he would be happy with that. When asked what advice he would give a budding social entrepreneur, he shared "..try to identify a real need for change, work hard, be resilient, and don't let the problems bog you down."
            <p>AquaHomes idea was entered into the ‘Homeless Hackathon’ hosted by Trinity College Dublin on the 22nd-24th of March 2019. The three day event was open to all students across disciplines to create innovative solutions to tackle Ireland's homelessness crisis. AquaHomes came joint third in LaunchBox, 
            <strong><a href="tangent.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link">Tangent, Trinity's Ideas Workspace </a></strong>in the Trinity Business School. The Tangent volunteers arrived early for the Tangent official launch and Tangent's Student Accelerator Programme on 5th September, 2019.<p>
            <h3>‘Homeless Hackathon’ Winning Teams /</h3>
            <p>Students participating in the hackathon ranged from undergraduates to PhD candidates; and came from diverse academic backgrounds. The two winning teams were:</p>

            </ol>

            <p>Participating teams were joined at the hackathon by representatives from homelessness and housing organisations, as well as social innovation coaches and mentors. In addition to Gavan Drohan, the judging panel for the event included: Kevin Gregory from Focus Ireland; Amy Power from the Social Innovation Fund; and Tim Crowley from O’Cualann Housing Alliance.</p>

            <p>AquaHomes founder <strong>James Kennedy</strong>. The idea for AquaHomes first originated when entrepreneur James Kennedy was walking by the 3 arena and saw the harbour close by. Thinking about the amount of concert goers who frequent the area, he thought if there were liveable boats on the dock, it could be rented out to people on <strong><a href="https://www.airbnb.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link">Airbnb</a></strong>. However, after hearing so much about the homeless and housing crisis in Ireland and even experiencing difficulty himself finding accommodation, Kennedy decided to run the idea but to focus on providing affordable housing to the masses instead.</p>
