ELEMENTS USED:

1. LINK TO BOTH MY OWN PAGES AND EXTERNAL PAGES

I used both 'absolute and relative paths' to link to my own pages,

and external pages. Links, both absolute (that link to externaal pages) and relative (links to my own pages),
are in dark orange and default underline is removed using the text-decortion: none; 


2. A NAVIGATION BAR 

A navigation bar is used on all 5 pages. 

3. TABLE

One table on tangent.html page and the table uses the :nth-child() selector to specify a different background 
colour that is the second of its parent (from w3schools.com) and the background colour chanes on (odd) and (even). I also used 'overflow-x:auto' to make the table responsive and set the width to 100%. 

4. LISTS (ORDERED AND UNORDERED)

Unordered list is used on the contact.html page and tangent.html page

Ordered list is on about.html page I used an idea from 'https://css-tricks.com/custom-list-number-styling' which
used a counter to increment the numbers and increase the size of the numbers in the ordered list.

Ordered lists is used on the contact page.

Unordered list on tangent.html page for the LaunchBox 2019 teams

5. EMBEDDED VIDEO

A video is embedded on the home page or index.html page. <video> .. </video>

6. CSS3 AND HTML5 

HTML5 elemnents used are: article, aside, footer, head, header, main, nav, section.

7. CSS POSITIONAL PROPERTIES (E.G. POSITION, FLOAT)

I used floats and control images and content in sections and header, aside, cols, article, lists (unordered and ordered) and video (on the index.html page).

8. INLINE AND BLOCK ELEMENTS 

nav li - inline  for the nav menu

inline-block not used

9. RESPONSIVE 

I used @media queries - '@media(max-width: 768px' to control the layout, and content such as images center on smaller devices. 


GOING BEYOND THE PARTS OF HTML AND CSS DESCRIBED IN LECTURES. 

All of the lectures pointed you to w3schools.com for further learning and I explored lots of CSS properties to use on my website and to help with the over all structure such as the 'property overflow - hidden' to control how the flow of content behaves on the page within block elements. Mostly it was trial and error when trying different CSS, such as opacity for images, border radius, should margins be set to 0 or auto and how the default browser margins behave or effect my CSS styles. I wanted the website to be responsive and I used @media queries for this, @media(max-width: 768px). to control how pages render for phone and tablet devices. I had a look at other websites such as 'theguardian.com' to get ideas for layout as we looked at this website a lot in class. I used CSS box-shadow on the gallery.html page because it makes the images look like old polaroid photos. The 'absolute link' use the target="_blank" so a new pages opens up and the user doesn't leave the website. I also used  rel="noopener" because according to 'https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/noopener' link to cross-origin destinations are unsafe. 


<aside> Defines content aside from the page content.

Used 'container' as a container div is good if you want the website to be centered. 


<header>...</header>
<section>...</section>
<section>...</section>
<section>...</section>
<footer>...</footer>

Reference: used for ideas on header, containers, floats, section.
