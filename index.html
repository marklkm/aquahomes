          <h2>AquaHomes /</h2>
          <p>AquaHomes is a rapid housing solution that aims to address Dublin’s homeless crisis. AquaHomes upcycles decommissioned rescue boats sourced from oil rigs into sustainable housing for those in need. AquaHomes is both a <strong>community organisation </strong> and <strong>social enterprise</strong>.</p>
          <p>The AquaHomes idea was entered into the <strong><a href="https://www.tcd.ie/news_events/articles/winning-ideas-from-hack-homelessness-event-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link">Homeless Hackathon</a></strong> hosted by Trinity College Dublin on the 22nd-24th of March 2019. The three day event was open to all students across disciplines to create innovative solutions to tackle Ireland's homelessness crisis.</p>
          <p>AquaHomes has been part of LaunchBox, the three month start-up accelerator in Trinity College Dublin. In which they benefited from benefited from office space, mentorship, and access to Trinity’s alumni, partner and investor networks. <strong>James Kennedy </strong>works  primarily on this project himself, with the help of his sisters and brother who works in finance. He calls it "a Kennedy family operation." Kennedy has recently attained the help of someone who worked on Computer Aided Design (CAD) and 3D printing, with the aim of potentially designing a custom-living boat in the future.</p>
